# README for Jets42 / Linux (on Github)
# Files, Scripts, Utilities and Notes that I'm using with Linux.
#------------------------------
# Some of these files I've been using for 10+ years, others are recent, or even being developed.
# I decided to setup a Git-Hub spot where I can save files, for use across multiple machines.
# ... also where I can let other people git a copy for shared use, or contribute ideas + improvements.
#
#------ Some initial content:
# jdf       df(j) DISK FREE script that can do a LOT more than standard "df" command in Unix/Linux
#           I started writing this for use with LARGE database servers, where we may have 140+ disk
#           file-systems, and want to list storage/capacity infor only FS that have XX+ Gig of space
#           available... or YY% used... with ability to exclude NFS, sort, total, and more.
# 
# cds       cd-stack  allows user to easily/quickly CD-jump to frequently used collections of DIRs.
#           Defines sets of DIRs for different tasks, allows push/pop/jump/save/load/etc. for Dirs.
#           Also makes PATH changes easy, in editor.  Can view/change some other $ENV settings.
#
# printty   Util for use of HP-PCL print formatting, or pass-through style printting from unix shell
#           command line level. Easy ESC-Code control for Landscape/Portrait, Font selection, etc.
#           
# .exrc     User pref and customization for "vi" editor (even before vim) compat with HP-UX 3.11
#           and Sun/Solaris as well, that adds Putty/PC key functionality for F1-F12, PgUp/Dn,Hm/End,
#           quick Alt/scratchpad buffer, shell, comment, Tag-jump, and more.
#
# .profile  Unix/Linus shell customizations for working environment. Mostly focused on Korn(ksh) use.
#           Also applicable for Bash shell on Linux.
#
# .alias    Quick shortcut commands, defined as 'alias' in shell, rather than seperate scripts.
# .ENV      Environment setup variables and preferences that get run for every new shell layer.
